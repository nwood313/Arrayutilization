As I started learning Java, this was the code that taught me how to properly utilize Arrays. 
I created a FileService to read a file and added the methodology to write as well. 
Using proper separation structure to keep it maintainable and readable, I added a separate (Student)Service to sort the data. 
After reading the original file, sorting out the data I wanted in a specific order, that data is written to 3 newly created CSV files.
